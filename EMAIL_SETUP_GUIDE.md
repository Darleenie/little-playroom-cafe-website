# 📧 Email Notification System Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This system automatically sends email notifications when users submit forms on your website. Instead of opening the user's email client, it sends emails **from `jiangdl0129@gmail.com` to itself** for easy monitoring.

## ⚙️ Current Configuration
- **Recipient Email**: `jiangdl0129@gmail.com` (for testing)
- **Email Service**: EmailJS (primary) + Formspree (fallback)
- **Self-Sending**: Emails are sent from your email to itself

## 🚀 Setup Options

### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Free & Simple)
Formspree is a free service that handles form submissions and sends emails automatically.

#### Step 1: Create Formspree Account
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up with your Google account (`jiangdl0129@gmail.com`)
3. Create a new form project

#### Step 2: Get Your Form ID
1. In your Formspree dashboard, create a new form
2. Copy the form ID (looks like: `xrgjqkqw`)
3. Update `email-config.js`:

```javascript
emailService: {
    // ... other settings ...
    formspreeFormId: 'xrgjqkqw' // Replace with your actual form ID
}
```

#### Step 3: Test the System
1. Submit any form on your website
2. Check your email (`jiangdl0129@gmail.com`)
3. You should receive an email from yourself with the form data

### Option 2: EmailJS (Professional Service)
EmailJS provides more advanced features and better deliverability.

#### Step 1: EmailJS Account Setup
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. Sign up with your Google account
3. Create a new email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

#### Step 2: Create Email Template
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Templates"
2. Create a new template with this structure:

```html
Subject: {{subject}}
From: {{from_name}} <{{from_email}}>
To: {{to_email}}

{{message}}

---
Form Type: {{form_type}}
Business: {{business_name}}
Address: {{business_address}}
Phone: {{business_phone}}
```

#### Step 3: Update Configuration
1. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and User ID
2. Update `email-config.js`:

```javascript
emailService: {
    serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',
    templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',
    userId: 'YOUR_USER_ID',
    formspreeFormId: 'YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID' // Keep this as backup
}
```

### Option 3: Custom Backend (Advanced)
For complete control, you can set up your own email server or use services like:
- **SendGrid** - Professional email delivery
- **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly email API
- **AWS SES** - Amazon's email service

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Form Submission Flow
```
User submits form → EmailService processes data → 
EmailJS (primary) or Formspree (fallback) → 
Email sent from jiangdl0129@gmail.com to itself
```

### 2. Fallback System
- **Primary**: EmailJS (if configured)
- **Fallback**: Formspree (if configured)
- **Last Resort**: Shows email content to user

### 3. Self-Sending Logic
```javascript
// All emails are sent FROM and TO the same address
from: 'jiangdl0129@gmail.com'
to: 'jiangdl0129@gmail.com'
```
